# Docker

There's also the possibility to run FROST-Server and the needed database inside one or multiple Docker containers.


## A Docker quick-start tutorial

If you have docker and docker-compose

1. Download our [docker-compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FraunhoferIOSB/FROST-Server/master/scripts/docker-compose.yaml) file:

    ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FraunhoferIOSB/FROST-Server/master/scripts/docker-compose.yaml```

2. Start the server with docker: `docker-compose up`
3. Fetch a json file with some [demo entities](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hylkevds/4ffba774fe0128305047b7bcbcd2672e/raw/demoEntities.json):

    ```wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hylkevds/4ffba774fe0128305047b7bcbcd2672e/raw/demoEntities.json```

4. Post it to the server:

    ```curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @demoEntities.json http://localhost:8080/FROST-Server/v1.1/Things```

5. Browse to http://localhost:8080/FROST-Server/v1.0
6. Enjoy!


## Details

There are three docker images available:

* [fraunhoferiosb/frost-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/fraunhoferiosb/frost-server/) The all-in-one package
* [fraunhoferiosb/frost-server-http](https://hub.docker.com/r/fraunhoferiosb/frost-server-http/) The HTTP-only package
* [fraunhoferiosb/frost-server-mqtt](https://hub.docker.com/r/fraunhoferiosb/frost-server-mqtt/) The MQTT-only package

To make deployment of these images easier, two example docker-compose files are provided.
The `docker-compose.yaml` file uses the all-in-one server, and adds the required postgresql / postgis database.
The `docker-compose-separated.yaml` file uses the separated HTTP and MQTT packages,
adds the required postgresql / postgis database, and adds a mosquitto server as a message bus.

You can start the all-in-one docker image by running `docker-compose up`, or you can start the separated docker images using `docker-compose -f docker-compose-separated.yaml up`.
This will download the latest version of the specified FROST-Server packages, and any dependencies, and starts it all.
You can access the server by opening `http://localhost:8080/FROST-Server/` in your browser.

If you want to build your own docker images, you can do this by calling:

```
mvn install
mvn dockerfile:build -pl FROST-Server.HTTP,FROST-Server.MQTT,FROST-Server.MQTTP
```

All data is stored inside the PostGIS database. To keep this state there's a volume automatically mapped to the PostGIS container.
For more information see the `docker-compose.yaml` file and the https://hub.docker.com/r/postgis/postgis/[PostGIS container documentation]

You can override all [configuration settings](../settings/settings.html) by using environment variables in the docker-compose files.
